# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

I've always wanted to learn how to code, and the opportunity to advance my career is what finally pushed me to take this course. I built this project as a way to dip my toes into the massive and complex world of coding. As I did each step, I became more and more familair with how coding worked. I hope that through this experience I am much better prepared for the entirety of the Bootcamp.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
